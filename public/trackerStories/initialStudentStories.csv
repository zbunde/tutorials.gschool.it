",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/63759234,,"Hints:
You now have to deal with date dependent code in your tests. In the most obvious implementation, if you run your tests on a Wednesday they will all pass but if you run them on any other day of the week they will fail. You have two options: 

1) Somehow freeze time so that you can test the price on Wednesday and on other days of the week. See https://rubygems.org/gems/timecop for one way to do that. It has already been added to the Gemfile so you don't need to do anything to use it.

2) Make the .price method take a parameter that you can ask a question to about if it is Wednesday or not.

Both are valid solutions. You pick which one you want to implement. We will talk about the benefits and the downsides of both in class.
